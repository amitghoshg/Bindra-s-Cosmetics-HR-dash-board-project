# Bindra-s-Cosmetics-HR-dash-board-project

As per the requirement of the company, I recently spearheaded the development of a comprehensive HR Dashboard using Power BI for Bindraâ€™s Cosmetics. This innovative project empowers our organization with real-time insights, enhancing our decision-making processes and enabling us to effectively manage our human resources.

Key highlights of the HR Dashboard project include:
1)	Data Visualization: I leveraged Power BI's capabilities to create visually appealing and easy-to-understand dashboards, providing at-a-glance access to Attrition rate, Average age, Sum of attrition count by 
    department, Job satisfaction rating etc .
2)	Interactive Reporting: Our dashboard allows users to drill down into data, filter information, and generate custom reports, fostering a culture of data-driven decision-making within the HR department.
3)	Data Analysis: Provide valuable insights to our company to take important discission through visualization and charts.  

This project reflects my passion for harnessing data to drive positive change within HR, resulting in improved workforce planning and talent management.
